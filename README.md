## Project Overview  
This project involves the development of a relational database designed for managing information within a medical insurance company. The database will support the companyâ€™s internal processes, including client management, insurance policies, healthcare service providers, claims, and payments. Additionally, it will facilitate the generation of reports for legal compliance and financial monitoring.  

The project was developed using SQL and includes tables, relationships, and constraints that form an efficient system for managing essential data in the medical insurance sector.  

### Main Objectives  
- Efficient database design  
- Query optimization  
- Relational data modeling  

### Features  
- **Client Management:** Recording personal client data and associating them with active or historical policies.  
- **Policy Management:** Creating a system for tracking insurance policies, including coverage details and validity periods.  
- **Healthcare Service Providers:** Listing providers (hospitals, clinics, doctors) and the services they offer.  
- **Petition for compensation Processing:** Registering petitions for compensation and tracking their status (approved, rejected, in progress).  
- **Payments and Reports:** Monitoring payments and generating financial reports required for legal compliance.  

### Schema Diagram  
You can view the updated database schema diagram in the main folder of this repository: **Medical_Insurance_Field_ERD_diagram.png** or **Medical_Insurance_Field_ERD_diagram.pdf**  

## Technologies Used  
- **Database:** SQL (compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)  
- **Tools:** SQLDeveloper

## How to use 

### Prerequisites:  
- An SQL-compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)  
- An SQL editor (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin)  

### Steps to run:  
1. **Download the SQL file:** Access the file **Medical_Insurance_Field_script.sql** from this repository.  
2. **Import the database:** Load the SQL file into a compatible database management system.  
3. **Run the queries:** Execute the SQL scripts to create tables and populate the database with necessary data.
4. **Practice exercices:** Access the file **Medical_Insurance_Field_practice_exercices.sql** and execute to observe how complex SQL queries are implemented for extracting, analyzing, and manipulating data in order to meet specific management requirements.
